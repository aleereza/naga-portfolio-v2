# Bio

My love for travelling, being a foodie, & having lived in AU, ENG, & CA now, freezing moments for years, helped me develop a passion for photography! I love to travel. (27 countries and counting!) I've lived in India, Australia, and England and I now call Canada my home. Being a foodie and wanting to document all the good food, initially helped me develop a passion for photography which has now developed into a job, which happens to be my passion as well, and I have so far covered Swing Dancing events, youth, & adult soccer league games, helping restaurants with producing content for their socials, covering corporate events, theatre, pet photography, assistant wedding photographer and of course, living on the west coast, I quite enjoy landscape as well as wild life photography and sell prints as well! I love telling a story with my pictures and freezing moments in time. I also provide video highlights of the events I cover for my clientâ€™s social media stories.
