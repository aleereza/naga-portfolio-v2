# About Me

My love for travelling, being a foodie, & having lived in Australia, England, & Canada now, freezing moments for years, helped me develop a passion for photography! I love to travel. (27 countries and counting!) I've lived in India, Australia, & England and I now call Canada my home. Being a foodie and wanting to document all the good food, initially helped me develop a passion for photography which has now developed into a job, and I have so far covered Swing Dancing events, kids & adult soccer league games, food photography, corporate events, theatre, pet photography, family portraits, weddings, summer camp, murals and of course, living on the west coast, I quite enjoy landscape photography and sell prints as well! I just love telling a story with my pictures and freezing moments in time. I also provide video highlights of the events I cover for my clientâ€™s social media stories.
