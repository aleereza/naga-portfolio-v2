# About Me

My passion for photography was ignited through my love for travel, my insatiable foodie spirit, and my diverse experiences living in India, Australia, England, and Canada. It's incredible how those seemingly unrelated interests have merged into a profession that allows me to capture and preserve life's most precious moments.

As an avid traveler, I've explored 27 countries and counting, and this journey has provided me with unique perspectives that enrich my photography. Originally, my desire to document the delectable world of cuisine fuelled my love for photography. Today, this passion has grown into a thriving career.

My portfolio is a testament to the diverse range of subjects I've had the privilege to photograph. From the dynamic energy of Swing Dancing events to the camaraderie of kids and adult soccer league games, from food photography to the formal settings of corporate events, and from the raw emotions of theatre performances to the endearing moments of pet photography, I've captured it all.

Families have trusted me to freeze their special moments in time through heart warming family portraits and weddings. I've also delved into the world of summer camps and the artistry of murals. As a resident of the picturesque west coast, I've developed a deep appreciation for landscape photography, offering my prints to those who share my love for the region's natural beauty.

My photography isn't just about taking pictures; it's about telling stories, about preserving memories and emotions in a single frame. I'm also passionate about creating engaging video highlights of the events I cover, perfect for sharing on clients' social media platforms.
