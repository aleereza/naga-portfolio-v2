I had the privilege of documenting the dynamic world of [2in1Soccer](https://www.2in1soccer.com/ "2in1Soccer"), a vibrant youth soccer academy located in North Surrey. My lens captured the essence of their regular training sessions, exhilarating friendly matches, and the heart warming moments during their end-of-season award and medal presentation ceremonies. Through my photography, I aimed to encapsulate the spirit, passion, and camaraderie that define 2in1 Soccer, providing a visual narrative of their dedication to nurturing young talent in the world of soccer.
