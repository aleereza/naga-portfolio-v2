It was a 2 day corporate [event](https://www.brandsforbetter.ca/brand-battle-for-good/ "event"), where they discussed ideas to tackle social isolation in Vancouver as it has only gotten worse since the recent pandemic. The first day was a virtual event and I was at the venue covering it and the second day was an in-person full-day event and I assisted the lead photographer on both days as a volunteer photographer.
