[Brand Battle for Good](https://www.brandsforbetter.ca/brand-battle-for-good/ "Brand Battle for Good"): In support of a 2-day event aimed at addressing the growing issue of social isolation in Vancouver exacerbated by the recent pandemic, I played a role in capturing the essence of the event. The first day was a virtual event, during which I covered the event at Clark's Audio Visual, and on the second day, a full-day, in-person event at the Roundhouse Community Centre unfolded. On this day, I worked closely with the lead photographer, contributing to the visual documentation of this important endeavour.
