It was a 2 day corporate event, where they discussed how to tackle isolation in Vancouver, while living and working from home. The sessions involved working on ideas to tackle isolation in our city, and a few local organization participated as a team, giving presentations, and it was narrowed down to 3 teams in the end and they presented in front of a new panel of 5 judges and one was picked and funded to action their ideas and I was given the opportunity to cover the event as a volunteer photographer.
