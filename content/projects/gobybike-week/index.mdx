As one of the photographers for [Go By Bike Week](https://bikehub.ca/bike-events/go-by-bike-week "Go By Bike Week"), I had the honour of capturing the heart and soul of HUB Cycling's impactful mission in Metro Vancouver. This project is dedicated to shining a light on their commitment to fostering healthier, happier, and more closely-knit communities through the promotion of cycling.

At its core, this project revolves around the vibrant Go by Bike Week event, a jubilant celebration of the cycling culture designed to inspire and engage Metro Vancouver residents in embracing cycling as a daily activity. Through my lens, I conveyed the energy, joy, and the sense of unity that this event generated, encouraged and motivated people to make cycling an integral part of their lives in the stunning backdrop of Vancouver's urban landscape.
