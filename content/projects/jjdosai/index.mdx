During my 3-month contract with JJ Dosai, I played an integral role in shaping their Instagram presence from the ground up. At the inception of this new culinary venture, my mission was to craft compelling visual narratives through food photography. Collaborating closely with the business owner, I brought their delectable monthly specials to life with mouthwatering imagery. Additionally, I contributed to the creation of engaging content for Instagram reels, effectively implementing our meticulously crafted social media strategy. This project not only showcased my adeptness in food photography but also demonstrated my ability to amplify a burgeoning business's digital footprint.
