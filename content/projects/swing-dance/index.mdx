I am the official photographer for Rock Step Swing Dance and cover everything from their indoor and outdoor dancing lessons during summer, and their special events. In this gallery you will see pictures from the 2021 Christmas event, from 2022 - outdoor welcome to swing dancing basics event at Trinity Western University campus, and an indoor fall live band dancing event.
