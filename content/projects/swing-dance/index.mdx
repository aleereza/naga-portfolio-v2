These are the photographs I've taken to document [Rock Step Swing Dance's](https://www.rockstepswingdance.ca/ "Rock Step Swing Dance's") indoor and outdoor dance lessons, along with their noteworthy events. Within this collection, you'll find images from the 2021 Christmas celebration and a selection from the 2022 "Swing Dancing Basics" outdoor event at Trinity Western University, an electrifying indoor live band swing dance event in the fall, and highlights from the Fort Langley Jazz Festival.
