It was a 2-day corporate event where they discussed ideas to tackle social isolation in Vancouver as it has only gotten worse since the recent pandemic. The first day was a virtual event and I was at the venue covering it and the second day was an in-person full-day event and I assisted the lead photographer on both days as a volunteer photographer.
