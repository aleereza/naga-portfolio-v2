In my role as a volunteer photographer, I documented approximately 35 live performances in low light theater environment, capturing captivating moments of the artists in action. I subsequently provided the [Fringe Festival's](https://www.vancouverfringe.com/ "Fringe Festival's") marketing and communications team with edited images for their use on social media.
