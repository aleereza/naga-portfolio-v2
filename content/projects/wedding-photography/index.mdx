I have so far assisted Roxana Albusel Photography at three weddings. The first one was at the end of 2021, in Downtown Vancouver at Wedgewood Hotel, the second wedding was in the summer of 2022, at Furry Creek Golf & Country Club, where I got aerial footage and pictures, and assisted the lead photographer at other times. The third one was a small wedding at the Bloedel Conservatory in Queen Elizabeth Park.
